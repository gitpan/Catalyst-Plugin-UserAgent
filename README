NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::UserAgent - Add a singleton LWP::UserAgent to the
    context

SYNOPSIS
      use Catalyst qw/ UserAgent /;

      __PACKAGE__->config(
          name => 'MyApp',
          lwp_user_agent => {
              agent      => 'MyApp/1.0',
              cookie_jar => {},
          },
      );

      sub foo : Local {
          my ($self, $c) = @_;

          my $content = $c->user_agent->get('http://example.com/')->content;

          $c->stash->{template} = 'show_example.com.tt2';
          $c->stash->{content} = $content;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Just creates a single LWP::UserAgent available to the context. This
    object is created on-demand.

    If you wish to pass any startup options to the constructor. Place those
    into the configuration under the key: "lwp_user_agent":

      __PACKAGE__->config(
          name => 'MyApp',
          lwp_user_agent => {
              agent      => 'MyApp/1.0',
              cookie_jar => {},
          },
      );

    To get the user agent instance, use the "user_agent" method of the
    Catalyst context:

      my $ua = $c->user_agent;
